# Lockr: Key Management Made Easy
Welcome to Lockr, the first hosted API and Encryption key solution built for the modern CMS. We effortlessly integrate into your website so you can stop worrying about your keys, and focus on your customers.

Lockr is built to be a simple solution to a complex problems:

- What do regulations  manage encryption and API keys?
- What is the best way to keep my e-commerce site secure?
- Where do I store this secret key that an API gave me?


## Our Partners
Lockr partners with hosting providers to take on the heavy lifting of security around our key management platform. In the end this leaves site builders and developers with quick setup and no ongoing maintenance. No more certificates to manage, keys to secure, and lengthy setup processes.

Currently Lockr is exclusive to the [Pantheon](https://pantheon.io/ "Pantheon: Wordpress and Drupal Website Management Platform") platform. This means that **all** sites on Pantheon are able to use Lockr without any additional steps. If you have not yet experienced Pantheon, head over and [create a site] (https://panthoen.io/register) in seconds with Pantheon for **free**.

If you're not currently on the Pantheon platform, have no fear. We're talking with numerous providers and will be providing integrations with many more in the coming weeks/months. In the meantime, you can request a custom connection certificate by [contacting us](mailto:support@lockr.io).

###Enterprise Solutions

Should you require a high volume license, SLA, or custom integration with your enterprise or corporate hosting, reach out to customer service and we'd be happy to set you up with the team to work out the details.

#Setup Instructions

##1. Download and Install the Module or Plugin

You can download Lockr from our Github repo (for the latest builds) or head to [our download page](https://lockr.io) to get the specific module for your CMS. From there, place it in your code repo where necessary (for Drupal in "/sites/all/modules/" and in Wordpress "/wp-content/plugins").

##2. Patch your Modules

Visit our [repo for patches](https://github.com/CellarDoorMedia/Lockr-Patches) to get an up to date patch for your favorite modules. Don't see a module or a plugin there and you need it? We'll patch it for you! Just [contact us](mailto:support@lockr.io) and we'll do all the work!

##3. Begin entering keys

Once enabled and your modules patched, you can now begin to enter keys and have them saved securely offsite in Lockr. **Note:** Lockr is environment aware, meaning we store production and development keys separately. This is done for security but also to save you the hassle of switching from dev/production keys. When you launch to live, be sure to go in and set your keys in production if you have not done so once before. Once set in production, there is no need to do it again as you make updates.
